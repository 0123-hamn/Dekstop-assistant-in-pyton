Project Title: AI Voice Assistant Using Python : Jarvis

Project Description:

This project involves building an AI-integrated voice assistant using Python that can interpret and execute voice commands from the user. The assistant leverages speech recognition

Key functionalities include:

1. Voice Command Recognition: The system uses libraries like `SpeechRecognition` and `PyAudio` to capture voice input and convert it to text.
2. Task Execution: Based on the interpreted command, the assistant can perform various tasks such as:
   Searching the web
   Managing system operations (open apps, play music, etc.)
   Providing real-time responses using AI module (e.g., OpenAI)
   Text-to-Speech Output: Responds using `pyttsx3` for spoken output.

Tech Stack:

  1. Python
   2. Libraries: `SpeechRecognition`, `PyAudio`, `pyttsx3`.
   3. Integration with OpenAI API or other AI models for advanced conversational capabilities
